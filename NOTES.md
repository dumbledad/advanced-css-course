# Tim's Notes for Jonas's Udemy  Advanced CSS course

- fonts in body not universal 
- reset margin and padding in universal `* { }`
- first background image is on top
- Clip path, percentages are useful
- Clippy, the CSS path maker https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/ 
- Position absolute is measured from the first parent container which is position relative
- Don't forget span for styling different bits of text in a (semantic) block
- block elements take entire width and have newline before and after
- keyframes are best animating just two properties, and browsers are optimised for them to be opacity and translation
